# client_flutter_app

A UI Flutter project for a Spring boot Application Server that hits at the chucknorris.io API.

## Getting Started
* Flutter for UI
* Dart for writing the Logic


Dart is AOT (Ahead Of Time) compiled to fast, predictable, native code, which allows almost all of Flutter to be written in Dart.
This not only makes Flutter fast, virtually everything (including all the widgets) can be customized.

Dart has features that are familiar to users of both static and dynamic languages like Java.
The Client Server Spring boot Application Controller Class passes the API and Services to the Flutter UI and the Logic to manipulate and construct the data being passed using Dart
